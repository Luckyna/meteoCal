DESCRIPTION:As the Dust Settles: using time-domain observations to reveal c
 loud structure in substellar atmospheres\n\nThe combination of condensate c
 louds and rapid rotation has long motivated searches for weather phenomena 
 in ultracool (late-M\, L and T) dwarf (UCD) atmospheres.  Pioneering work i
 n this field dating back as early as 1999 suggested that variability is qui
 te common for UCDs.  Yet these early studies were ambiguous:  detections we
 re often low-amplitude and/or lacking periodicity\, and the mechanisms resp
 onsible remained unclear.  Observations made in the past 5 years\, utilizin
 g continuous monitoring strategies\, better instruments\, and larger telesc
 opes have demonstrated conclusive and surprisingly large near-infrared vari
 ability for a subset of brown dwarfs at the transition between L and T spec
 tral types\, suggesting a patchy distribution of silicate clouds in their a
 tmospheres.  Brightness variations as large as 25% on readily observable ro
 tational timescales allow light curves of exquisite precision\, worthy of d
 etailed analysis\, to be obtained from both ground and space based faciliti
 es.  While the L/T transition is the realm of spectacular variability\, rec
 ent space-based efforts have confirmed lower levels of variability for a su
 bstantial fraction of UCDs at all spectral types.  I will describe how such
  multi-wavelength\, multi-epoch observations are contributing to an emergin
 g picture of cloud structure in brown dwarf and exoplanet atmospheres.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Stellar Resonant Absorption of Gravitational Waves\nAbst
 ract: Massive binaries are expected to produce gravitational waves (GW) ove
 r a range of frequencies.  Some of these will coincide with the natural fre
 quencies of stellar oscillations\, allowing resonant driving of stellar osc
 illations by GW. Stars (including the Sun) can occult and dim (up to O(10%)
 ) GW sources by absorbing some of the GW energy\; stars near supermassive b
 lack hole binaries (SMBHB) should also absorb significant energy from GWs\,
  which may be re-radiated as electromagnetic energy. The exact opacity of s
 tars to GWs depends on the details of stellar structure. I will also discus
 s some expected electromagnetic signatures of massive black hole binaries i
 n galactic nuclei (including intermediate mass black hole-supermassive blac
 k hole binaries). Some of these will be electromagnetic 'advanced warning' 
 systems for GW detectors.

DESCRIPTION:The initial conditions of star formation in a turbulent interst
 ellar medium.\n\nAbstract: What controls the star formation rate in our gal
 axy and in other galaxies remains an unsolved question. The majority of the
  stars formed in the galaxy occur in a clustered fashion inside dense molec
 ular clouds. Understanding how these molecular clouds form\, evolve and col
 lapse under their own gravity is necessary for understanding the star forma
 tion rate of the galaxy. We use numerical simulations to study the dynamica
 l evolution of the self-gravitating\, magnetized\, turbulent ISM in a verti
 cal column of a disk galaxy. Turbulence\, driven by supernovae (SN) and sup
 erbubble (SB) explosions\, may provide the velocity dispersion required to 
 support the disk from collapsing. SN explosions also drive the galactic fou
 ntain\, where gas blown to high altitudes cools and falls back to the midpl
 ane. Most of the gas mass is observed to be concentrated around the galacti
 c midplane (|z| < 50pc) in the form of cold\, dense clouds. When these dens
 e structures become self-gravitating\, they quickly begin to collapse and f
 ragment\, following the background structure left by the turbulence. Rich f
 ilamentary structure and sub-structure is observed throughout the midplane 
 providing the initial conditions for star formation\, with morphology simil
 ar to that observed in infra red dark clouds. We show that star forming clo
 uds are strongly affected by the environment in which they form due to gas 
 accretion and mergers with other clouds.

DESCRIPTION:Title:  Is the stellar initial mass function a probability dens
 ity distribution function?\, and how to make a galaxy's stellar population\
 n\nAbstact: The stellar initial mass function (IMF) is usually assumed to b
 e a probability density distribution function. Recent data appear to rule o
 ut this interpretation though\, and I will discuss alternative more realist
 ic applications and results concerning the possibly true nature of the IMF.
  Empirical evidence has emerged that the IMF becomes top-heavy in intense s
 tar bursts and at low metallicity. Related to the IMF are binary star distr
 ibution functions\, and these evolve through dynamical processes in embedde
 d star clusters. The insights gained from these considerations lead to a ma
 thematically computable method for calculating stellar populations in galax
 ies\, with possibly important implications for the matter cycle in galaxies
 . It turns out that the galaxy-wide IMF\, the IGIMF\, becomes increasingly 
 top-heavy with increasing galaxy-wide star formation rate\, while at the sa
 me time the binary fraction in the galactic field decreases.

DESCRIPTION:Determining Fundamental Parameters for an Age Calibrated Sequen
 ce of the Lowest Mass Stars to the Highest Mass Planets\n\nUnable to sustai
 n nuclear fusion in their cores due to insufficient mass\, all ultracool dw
 arfs (>M6) older than 500 Myr are about the radius of Jupiter\, emit primar
 ily in the infrared\, and are degenerate across effective temperature (Teff
 )\, mass\, and age. These observational challenges make determinations of f
 undamental parameters using stellar detection techniques very difficult for
  a large\, diverse sample of low mass objects. However\, spectral energy di
 stributions (SED) with optical through mid-infrared data allow detailed spe
 ctroscopic study of the substellar regime over a broad wavelength baseline 
 as well as estimates of bulk properties via direct measurement of bolometri
 c flux. I construct nearly complete SEDs for a sample of 192 ultracool dwar
 fs across Teff of 600-3200K for both field age (>500 Myr) and young (10-150
  Myr) objects. I use parallaxes and kinematic distances to determine precis
 e bolometric luminosities and then use radii estimates from evolutionary mo
 dels to calculate Teff for the full sample of late-M\, L and T dwarfs. With
  these results I derive new age-sensitive temperature/ spectral type relati
 onships and bolometric corrections for the entire sequence\, and characteri
 ze the redistribution of flux from the near- to mid-infrared wavelength ran
 ges in the atmospheres of young L dwarfs. Finally\, I propose a future cour
 se of work to compare these results to fundamental parameters obtained by f
 itting model atmospheres to this unprecedented sample of SEDs. A robust fit
 ting routine that accounts for over 97% of the flux of any object in such a
  large\, age-calibrated sequence will improve identification and characteri
 zation of ultracool dwarfs and be a valuable test for future suites of mode
 ls. I will also attempt to identify and characterize more young T dwarfs in
  order to extend my analysis well into the planetary regime. I will then be
  in a unique position to disentangle the effects of Teff\, age and mass on 
 emergent flux and test formation and evolution theories of substellar objec
 ts.

DESCRIPTION:Constraining the CV evolution with SW Sex stars and old novae\n
 \nFrom a large observing campaign\, we find that nearly all non- or weakly 
 magnetic Cataclysmic Variables (CVs) in the orbital period range between 2.
 8 and 4 hours are of SW Sex sub-type and as such experience very high mass 
 transfer rates. As the evolution of CVs is driven by angular momentum loss 
 which results in a decrease of the orbital period\, all long-period CVs nee
 d to cross this SW Sex regime of the orbital period distribution before ent
 ering the period gap. This makes the SW Sex phenomenon an evolutionary phas
 e in the life of a cataclysmic variable.\n\nOn the other hand\, some old no
 vae in this period range which are expected to show high mass transfer rate
  instead resemble low-mass transfer systems like dwarf novae. I will discus
 s them as candidates for so-called hibernating systems\, CVs that changed t
 heir mass transfer behaviour due to a previously experienced nova outburst.

DESCRIPTION:Imaging Planets and Disks with an Eye on the Future\n\nWe are p
 robably still decades away from being able to directly image an Earth-like 
 planet around another star. However\, with each passing year\, we make sign
 ificant advances towards achieving this goal. Young gas giant planets can n
 ow be directly imaged\, giving us clues to their atmospheric compositionsât
 he kind of information we will one day seek for Earth 2.0. In the meantime\
 , several other questions need to be answered: What do other planetary syst
 ems look like? What is the connection between planets and debris disks? Do 
 the ingredients necessary for life exist around other stars? \n\nIn this ta
 lk\, I will present research results on four different topics related to an
 swering these questions. First\, I will discuss my work on radial velocity 
 (RV) eccentricity bias. For years astronomers have been puzzled about the l
 arge number of RV-detected planets that have eccentric orbits (e > 0.1). I 
 will show that this problem can be partially explained when two circular-or
 bit planets masquerade as a single planet on an eccentric orbit. I use this
  finding to predict that planets with mildly eccentric orbits are the most 
 likely to have massive companions on wide orbits\, potentially detectable b
 y future direct imaging observations. Second\, I will present direct imagin
 g results on an old RV planetary systemâan attempt at combining two powerfu
 l planet detection techniques that will one day be crucial for determining 
 the true mass distribution of extrasolar planets. I will also discuss a new
  program I am leading to image long-period companions with MagAO. Third\, I
  will present direct imaging results on several bright debris disks (includ
 ing a brand new one) in the visible and near-infrared using the LBT and Mag
 AO. Imaging at these wavelengths is a window into the composition of the du
 st grains scattering the star light\, allowing us to determine how much (if
  any) water ice and/or organic materials are present. Finally\, I will pres
 ent my bold foray into theory to understand and characterize the observatio
 nal signatures planets dynamically leave on debris disks. I will show how b
 igger planets create broader disks\, meaning we can use debris disk widths 
 to estimate an interior shepherding planet's mass. This will prove especial
 ly useful to planet imagers in the coming years for both searching for and 
 characterizing new disk-shepherding planets.\n

DESCRIPTION:How asteroids break apart due to fast rotation? A consequence o
 f their 'rubble-pile' structure\n \nA newly exciting discovered category of
  asteroid pairs consists of asteroids that share very similar orbital eleme
 nts but are gravitationally unbound (Vokrouhlicky & Nesvorny 2008). Studies
  have shown that these pairs are fragments of strength-less asteroids\, cal
 led ârubble-pilesâ\, that failed to remain bound against an increasing rota
 tion rate. Since these disintegration events are dated to the last 10^6 yea
 rs they serve as a unique\, almost âliveâ experiments for asteroid evolutio
 n\, and can teach us about the internal structure of asteroids and about th
 eir evolution.\n \nWe perform a spectroscopic and photometric survey of ast
 eroid pairs that search for correlations between age-related mechanisms tha
 t modify the spectra (e.g.\, space weathering) to other parameters such as 
 dynamical age\, size and shape. The observations allow us to confirm a theo
 retical model of rotational-disruption (Jacobson & Scheeres 2011) in which 
 the ejected component itself disintegrates due to continuous torques and ti
 dal forces applied by the main body. This mechanism can result with the exp
 osure of significant amount of âfreshâ\, non-weathered material from below 
 the surface. This is indeed found by our survey that located the first âfre
 shâ main-belt asteroids observed over the full visible and near-infrared ra
 nge.\n \nThe study was published in: Polishook et al.\, 2014. Observations

DESCRIPTION:Dating middle-aged stars\n\nWe have recently demonstrated that 
 Ruprecht 147 (NGC 6774) is the oldest nearby open cluster\, with an age of 
 3 Gyr at 300 pc\, which allows it to serve as a sorely needed intermediate-
 aged benchmark. Stellar ages are difficult to infer for main sequence stars
 \, but age can reveal itself through the spin down of stars via magnetic br
 aking\, which also causes magnetic activity to wane with time. I will discu
 ss our efforts to characterize this cluster and determine its membership\, 
 what we have learned so far about magnetic activity at 3 Gyr\, and will out
 line our projects underway targeting the low-mass stars\, white dwarf\, and
  blue straggler populations\, Lithium depletion\, and exoplanet searches in
  this cluster environment. For more information\, see Curtis et al. (2013)\

DESCRIPTION:Title:\nObserving the Origins of Galaxy Structure in Simulation
 s\n\nAbstract:\nIt remains debated whether galaxy mergers\, gas flows\, or 
 internal processes shape the population of galaxies we see today.  I will d
 escribe work to disentangle these issues using mock data derived from hydro
 dynamical simulations of galaxy formation.  First\, I use model IR and opti
 cal spectra to diagnose galaxy mergers\, showing that the number of post-st
 arburst galaxies is consistent  with independent estimates of the galaxy me
 rger rate.  This owes to an underappreciated fact: not all major mergers ar
 e likely to produce a major starburst. \nPrimarily\, I will describe how we
  study galaxy morphology by building "mock observatories" around cosmologic
 al simulations.  With these\, we address how the common galaxy shapes emerg
 ed and how they relate to cessation of star formation in the universe.  Ear
 ly results suggest realistic populations of galaxy disks and bulges are a n
 atural consequence of galaxy formation models with black hole and star form
 ation feedback set to reproduce global quantities.  Such simulations make r
 eadily falsifiable predictions that can be pressured by future surveys\, an
 d I will describe how we use these mock data to create diagnostics of galax
 y dynamics.

DESCRIPTION:"Hot rocky to gas planets: How host stars and realistic UV flux
  change the detectable features for Mini-Neptunes and rocky atmospheres"\n\
 nRecent ground and space surveys resulted in the detection of many hot extr
 asolar planets. These planets are interesting targets for current and futur
 e observations\, therefore\, addressing their atmospheric structure and com
 position is a major issue and the aim of my work. For the hot potentially r
 ocky exoplanets with an outgassed atmosphere we developed a simple approach
  to find their atmospheric composition according to their observable data (
 radius\, semi-major axis and stellar effective temperature). For hot mini-N
 eptune and giant planets's atmospheres\, we calculated an atmospheric grid 
 that links astrophysical observable parameters - orbital distance and stell
 ar type - with the atmospheric species expected in exoplanet atmospheres. W
 e link a 1D code that calculates the atmospheric thermal structure with a p
 hotochemical model that includes disequilibrium chemistry and explore the e
 ffect of empirical model parameters on the results\, for planets around a w
 ide range of stellar types from F to M\, including the effect of high FUV r
 adiation on their atmospheres. Our results can be applied to current and fu
 ture observations to characterize exoplanet atmospheres and serves as a ref

 . Yet of the nearly 600\,000 asteroids that have been discovered to date\, 
 only several thousand had any sort of\nphysical measurements made of them b

  robust diameter measurements for >158\,000 minor planets. Radiometric tech
 niques allow for the study of sizes\, albedos\, thermal inertia\, and light
 curves for large numbers of asteroids. Dust temperatures\, production rates
 \, particle size distributions\, and CO/CO2 abundances can be derived\nfor 
 comets. The mission\, now renamed NEOWISE\, has recently been restarted\nto

DESCRIPTION:Title:  On the Origins of Globular Clusters:  Using Stellar Dyn
 amics to Constrain Star Formation in the Proto-Milky Way\n\nAbstract:\nGlob
 ular Clusters are the oldest and most massive star clusters in the Milky Wa
 y\, with masses of up to over a million solar masses and ages that approach
  a Hubble time.  Given their long survival times\, these ancient relics rep
 resent the only remaining windows into star formation in the early local Un
 iverse.  However\, they have changed significantly over their lifetimes due
  to dynamics\, stellar and binary evolution. In this talk\, I will present 
 an on-going theoretical modeling campaign to rewind the dynamical clocks of
  globular clusters\, and constrain their properties as they emerged from th
 e gas-embedded phase.  The main limitation of this project is the extensive
  parameter space of plausible initial conditions that needs to be explored\
 , and the associated computational expense.  I will discuss several modelin
 g techniques that can be used to help overcome this considerable challenge.
   In particular\, I will explain how to extrapolate from only a handful of 
 models to predict the present-day properties of the entire Milky Way globul
 ar cluster population for every set of initial conditions.  By comparing th
 e results of a series of Monte Carlo and N-body simulations for cluster evo
 lution to the present-day observed cluster properties\, I will constrain th
 e initial distributions of total cluster masses\, stellar mass functions\, 
 concentrations and binary properties for the bulk of the Milky Way globular
  cluster population.  With these constraints in hand\, I will comment on wh
 at these results can tell us about the gas-embedded phase of cluster evolut
 ion\, and star formation in the early local Universe.

DESCRIPTION:"Ultraviolet digital imaging of volcanic plumes: Implementation
  and application to magmatic processes at basaltic volcanoes"\n\nMagmatic v
 olatiles play a crucial role in volcanism\, from magma production at depth 
 to generation of seismic phenomena to control of eruption style. Accordingl
 y\, many models of volcano dynamics rely heavily on behavior of such volati
 les. Yet measurements of emission rates of volcanic gases have historically
  been limited\, which has restricted model verification to processes on the
  order of days or longer.\n \nUV cameras are a recent advancement in the fi
 eld of remote sensing of volcanic SO2 emissions. They offer enhanced tempor
 al and spatial resolution over previous measurement techniques\, but need d
 evelopment before they can be widely adopted and achieve the promise of int
 egration with other geophysical datasets. Large datasets require a means by
  which to quickly and efficiently use imagery to calculate emission rates. 
 We present a suite of programs designed to semi-automatically determine emi
 ssion rates of SO2 from series of UV images. Extraction of high temporal re
 solution SO2 emission rates via this software facilitates comparison of gas
  data to geophysical data for the purposes of evaluating models of volcanic
  activity and has already proven useful at several volcanoes.\n \nIntegrate
 d UV camera and seismic measurements recorded in January 2009 at Fuego volc
 ano\, Guatemala\, provide new insight into the systemâs shallow conduit pro
 cesses. High temporal resolution SO2 data reveal patterns of SO2 emission r
 ate relative to explosions and seismic tremor that indicate tremor and dega
 ssing share a common source process. Progressive decreases in emission rate
  appear to represent inhibition of gas loss from magma as a result of rheol
 ogical stiffening in the upper conduit. Measurements of emission rate from 
 two closely-spaced vents\, made possible by the high spatial resolution of 
 the camera\, help constrain this model.\n \nUV camera measurements at Kilau
 ea volcano\, Hawaii\, in May of 2010 captured two occurrences of lava filli
 ng and draining within the summit vent. Accompanying high lava stands were 
 diminished SO2 emission rates\, decreased seismic and infrasonic tremor\, m
 inor deflation\, and slowed lava lake surface velocity. Incorporation of UV
  camera data into the multi-parameter dataset gives credence to the likelih
 ood of shallow gas accumulation as the cause of such events.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Exposing the Long Lives of Circumplanetary Disks\nAbstra
 ct:\nDuring the formation of gas giant planets\, gaseous disks form around 
 them. These disks are called circumplanetary disks\, and are believed to be
  the formation sites of satellites. Although an understanding of disk evolu
 tion is required for developing theories of satellite formation\, gas accre
 tion rates of\ncircumplanetary disks are very uncertain. The most promising
  mechanism of gas\naccretion is thought to be magnetic turbulence which is 
 driven by magnetorotational instability (MRI). For the disks to be MRI-acti
 ve\, gas in the disks must be sufficiently ionized. We built disk models fo
 r circumplanetary disks considering gas infall from protoplanetary disks ba
 sed on a 3D simulation and calculated the ionization degree to investigate 
 the MRI activeity. If there are no dust grains\, thin active layers may app
 ear at upper surface\; however\, we find that there are almost no active la
 yers in regions of satellite formation with sufficient small grains. Our re
 sults suggest that the lifetime of circumplanetary disks may be longer than
  previously thought\, perhaps longer than the parental protoplanetary disks
  if MRI is the only mechanism for gas accretion. In order to find out if th
 is is the case or not\, we need to investigate other mechanisms.

 ct: Although the identification of the progenitors of type Ia Supernovae (S
 NeIa) remains controversial\, it is generally accepted that they originate 
 from binary star systems in which at least one component is a carbon-oxygen
  white dwarf (WD)\; those systems are grouped under the wide umbrella of ca
 taclysmic variables (CVs). Current theories for SNeIa progenitors hold that
 \, either via Roche lobe overflow of the companion or via a wind\, the WD a
 ccumulates Hydrogen or Helium rich material which is then burned to C and O
  onto the WDâs surface. However\, the specifics of this scenario are far fr
 om being understood or defined\, allowing for a wealth of theories fighting
  for attention and a dearth of observations to support them. I discuss the 
 latest attempts to identify and study those controversial SNeIa progenitors
 . I also introduce the most promising progenitor in hand and I present obse
 rvational diagnostics that can reveal more members of the category.

 s-loss\, possibly dominated by poorly understood stellar eruptions and epis
 odic mass ejections. Copious mass loss leads to circumstellar dust formatio
 n\, obscuring the star in the optical. But as the light is absorbed and re-
 emitted by the dust\, these objects become very luminous in mid-infrared li

 a Car have been found so far in our or other galaxies. I present the result
 s of our systematic search for eta Car analogs in 7 galaxies utilizing Spit
 zer\, Herschel\, HST and other data. While strict eta Car analogs remain to

 eavily dust obscured\, evolved massive stars. I will describe the propertie

DESCRIPTION:TITLE\nFrom clouds to cores to envelopes to disks: a multi-scal
 e view of magnetized star formation\n\n\nABSTRACT\nMagnetic fields are thou
 ght to play an important role in the formation of stars.  However\, that im
 portance has been called into question by previous observations showing mis
 alignment between protostellar outflows and magnetic fields (B-fields)\, as
  well as inconsistency in field morphology between 10\,000 AU and 1\,000 AU
  scales.  To investigate these inconsistencies\, we used the 1.3 millimeter
  full-Stokes polarimeter at CARMA to map dust polarization with ~2.5" resol
 ution toward 29 star-forming cores and 8 high-mass star-forming regions as 
 part of the TADPOL survey.  We find that a subset of the sources have consi
 stent B-field orientations between the large (~20") scales measured by sing
 le-dish submillimeter bolometers and the small scales measured by CARMA. Th
 ose same sources also tend to have higher fractional polarizations\, presum
 ably because the B-fields are less twisted by dynamic effects. However\, ev
 en in these sources\, which seem to have retained the memory of the global 
 B-field direction\, the fields in the cores are misaligned with the disks a
 nd outflows in the central protostars -- a key previous result of the TADPO
 L survey.  Furthermore\, the protostellar cores with lower polarization fra
 ctions tend to have B-fields that are preferentially perpendicular to outfl
 ows\, which suggests that in these sources the B-fields have lost the memor
 y of the larger-scale global field\, and have been wrapped up by core rotat
 ion. This is an important result for disk formation theory\, as it suggests
  that field misalignment may indeed be the solution to the magnetic braking
  catastrophe.  \n\nFor the TADPOL paper discussing the misalignment of outf

 tars\, defined to be brighter and bluer than the main sequence turnoff in a
  star cluster\, has been a question for almost six decades. The blue stragg
 ler population of the old (7 Gyr) open cluster NGC 188 provides a unique op
 portunity to probe the formation histories of blue straggler stars in open 
 clusters. In comparison to the blue straggler populations in younger open c
 lusters and in globular clusters\, the cooler temperatures (6\,000 to 6\,75
 0 K) and close proximity (2.5 kpc) of the blue stragglers in NGC 188 allow 
 for in-depth high-resolution spectroscopic investigation. Long-term radial 
 velocity studies revealed that over 75% of the NGC 188 blue stragglers exis
 t in binaries with a prevalence of 1000-day periods and a statistical secon
 dary mass distribution that peaks at 0.5 Msolar. Using HST/ACS/SBC far-UV p
 hotometry I will present direct observational detections of young (<300 Myr
 )\, hot white dwarf companions in three blue straggler binaries. Given the 
 age distribution predicted in full N-body models\, which translates into a 
 white dwarf temperature distribution\, three detections is consistent with 
 the entire NGC 188 blue straggler population being formed via mass transfer
 . These detections affirm the prediction made by previous studies that the 
 blue straggler population of NGC 188 is dominated by mass transfer formatio
 n.

  rocky super-Earths. We show that differences in mass loss history provide

 ds with a wide range of the input Poynting flux\nfrom the photosphere. Incr
 easing the magnetic field strength\nand the turbulent velocity at the stell

 ncreases\nat first owing to the suppression of the reflection of the Alfven
  waves.\nThe surface materials are lifted up by the magnetic pressure assoc
 iated\nwith the Alfven waves\, and the cool dense chromosphere is intermitt
 ently\nextended to 10 -- 20 % of the stellar radius. The dense atmospheres 
 enhance\nthe radiative losses and eventually most of the input Poynting ene
 rgy\nfrom the stellar surface escapes by the radiation. As a result\, there
 \nis no more sufficient energy remained for the kinetic energy of the wind\
 ;\nthe stellar wind saturates in very active stars\, as observed in Wood et
  al.\nThe saturation level is positively correlated with B_{r\,0}f_0\, wher
 e B_{r\,0}\nand f_0 are the magnetic field strength and the filling factor\
 nof open flux tubes at the photosphere. If B_{r\,0}f_0 is relatively\nlarge
  >~ 5 G\, the mass loss rate could be as high as 1000 times.\nIf such a str
 ong mass loss lasts for ~ 1 billion years\, the stellar mass\nitself is aff
 ected\, which could be a solution to the faint young sun paradox.\nWe deriv

DESCRIPTION:Galaxy assembly in simulations with realistic star formation an
 d feedback\n\nWe investigate the process of baryon assembly in galaxies\, f
 ocusing for the first time on the effects of radiation from young clusters 
 on the baryonic fraction and the star formation histories of galaxies simul
 ated in a cosmological setting to the present epoch. We incorporate a reali
 stic model of star formation and stellar feedback in galaxy formation simul
 ations based on the latest understanding from observations of star forming 
 regions. Our feedback model is based on observations of the mechanisms that
  disperse molecular clouds around star forming regions. We include radiatio
 n pressure from young star clusters\, as well as energy from supernova expl
 osions and stellar winds. We also implement a model of local star formation
  in which stars form in cold and dense gas with a small efficiency per free
 -fall time\, as observed in studies of galactic molecular clouds. We find t
 hat radiation pressure from young clusters has a strong effect on the star 
 formation process in galaxies\, especially at high redshift. In galaxies wi
 th masses ranging from dwarfs to massive spirals\, feedback efficiently sup
 presses star formation by dispersing and heating high density gas\, mostly 
 in the central regions\, with the potential to completely suppress the form
 ation of a massive bulge in a spiral galaxy. For the first time in simulati
 ons\, we observe the process of galaxy downsizing\, in which the early regu
 lation of the star formation due to radiative feedback is responsible for t
 he bulk of the stellar mass assembly occurring in the last half of cosmic h
 istory\, in contrast to the hierarchical assembly of the dark matter halo. 
 In addition\, the cold baryon fractions in simulated galaxies with radiativ
 e feedback are several times smaller than those obtained with only supernov
 a feedback. We conclude that radiation pressure is the only mechanism that 
 is able to dispense dense star forming gas to regulate the star formation r
 ate at high redshift\, as well as launch gas in galactic fountains and even
  massive outflows that reduce the cold baryon fraction within the halo of a
  dwarf galaxy to values 0.5-2%\, in very good agreement with abundance matc
 hing models.

DESCRIPTION:A modified bayesian analysis to search for young brown dwarfs\n
 \nIn this talk\, I will present the latest modifications we brought to our 
 Bayesian method in the goal of searching for young\, low-mass objects in ne
 arby\, young associations. With this new method\, we can assess membership 
 probabilities for objects with only their sky position and proper motion\, 
 as well as predicting their suspected radial velocity and distance. We have
  applied this method to the whole sky using the 2MASS and WISE surveys\, an
 d started a spectroscopic follow-up of the most promising candidates to sea
 rch for signs of youth in their optical and/or NIR spectra. We will present
  here our first results\, showing that we can get a fraction of young objec
 ts as high as 75% if we carefully choose which candidates to follow. We als
 o find that this specific method has the potential to unveil objects whose 
 masses span the whole range from low-mass stars to planetary-mass objects. 
 I will also briefly talk about a Montecarlo simulation that sheds light on 
 the expected recovery rate and contamination fraction of our method.

 Fomalhaut b a planet?\n\nThe irregular satellites of each of the giant plan

  the respective inner moons due to Poynting-Robertson drag.  Uranus is uniq
 ue in that it has an extreme axial tilt of 98Â°.  This renders a range of ci
 rcumplanetary orbits around the planet unstable\, and debris that enters th
 is region will undergo chaotic\, large-amplitude oscillations in orbital ec
 centricity and inclination.  I will argue that this could explain the hemis
 pherical color asymmetries observed on the Uranian inner moons.\n\nFomalhau
 t b is a controversial candidate among the few directly-imaged exoplanets. 
  Recently\, Kalas et al. announced the results of two additional epochs of 
 observation that show this object to be on an extremely eccentric orbit.  I
  will argue that this sets stringent limits on the possible mass of Fomalha

 spectrum-estimation techniques allow us to probe the acoustic peaks deep in
 to the damping tail\, and allow for confirmation of the concordance model\,

 dio sources and a term modeling the correlation between the thermal SZ effe

DESCRIPTION:On the Formation and Evolution of Massive Galaxies\n\nLooking b
 ackwards we have been able to reconstruct from the detailed structure of ou
 r own Galaxy and from the fossil evidence derived from the study of nearby 
 galaxies a plausible history of how galaxies formed over the last several b
 illion years. In addition\, now that we have a quite definite cosmological 
 model\, providing us with a quantitative picture of how perturbations grew 
 from very low amplitude Gaussian fluctuations\, we can perform the forward 
 modeling of representative pieces of the universe using standard physical p
 rocesses to see how well we match our local knowledge and the time-reversed
  modeling based on the fossil evidence. Finally\, we can employ large groun
 d and space based telescopes to use the universe as a time-machine â direct
 ly observing the past history of our light-cone.  While none of these appro
 aches can give us at the present time results accurate to more than roughly
  the 5% -> 10% level\, a coherent and plausible picture is emerging.  Massi
 ve galaxies form in two phases. In the first phase\, which peaks at redshif
 t z = 6 and ends by redshift z = 2\, cold gas streams in\, making stars in 
 a small (<1kpc) region\, but as the stellar mass approaches 1011 Msolar\, a
  hot bubble forms which suppresses further inflow of cold gas. But from red
 shift z = 3 to the present time\, small stellar satellite systems are accre
 ted at typically 10kpc from the center and the size of the total system gro
 ws by about a factor of three as the mass doubles. This added\, accreted co
 mponent is mainly comprised of old and low metallicity stars. Energy releas
 e from gravitational infall in various forms will terminate star-formation 
 even in the absence of feedback from SN or MBHs. This physical picture seem
 s naturally to lead to the mass\, size\, scale and epoch of galaxy formatio
 n and\, increasingly\, to a first understanding of the detailed internal st
 ructure of these systems.

DESCRIPTION:Dust Reddened Quasars:  A Transitional Phase in Quasar/Galaxy C
 o-Evolution\n\nQuasars are extremely luminous sources\, powered by accretio
 n of gas onto a supermassive black hole in the nucleus of some galaxies. Mo
 st of the >100\,000 quasars identified in the literature have been selected
  using optical surveys through the "ultraviolet excess" (UVX) method.  Howe
 ver\, these samples are known to be incomplete and biased because of obscur
 ation and anisotropic radiation.  Furthermore\, a population of dust-obscur
 ed\, red quasars is predicted by merger-driven models of quasar/galaxy co-e
 volution. To test these models\, I have conducted a survey for a large popu
 lation of dust-reddened quasars identified by matching radio sources from t
 he FIRST 1.4 GHz survey with the 2MASS near-infrared survey and selecting o
 bjects with red optical-to-near-infrared colors.  Follow up spectroscopy of
  these candidates in the optical and/or near-infrared has identified 120 re
 d quasars\, defined as having at least one broad emission line and a redden
 ing of E(B-V)>0.1. The sample spans a wide redshift range\, 0.1 < z < 3 and
  reaches a reddening of E(B-V)<1.5. When corrected for extinction\, red qua
 sars are the most luminous objects at every redshift and the fraction of re
 d quasars increases with luminosity. The properties of red quasars suggest 
 that they are revealing a transitional phase where the heavily obscured qua
 sar is emerging from its dusty environment prior to becoming a "normal" blu
 e quasar.  Based on the fraction of quasars that are in this red phase\, I 
 determine that its duration is 20% as long as the unobscured quasarâs phase
 : a few million years.\n\nI will also present future and ongoing work to ex
 pand this sample to fainter flux limits and longer wavelengths.  And I will
  describe additional observations focused on subsamples of these red quasar
 s to better understand their role in the co-evolution of supermassive black
  holes and their host galaxies.

DESCRIPTION:The Astrophysics of Planet Formation\n\nOver the past twenty-on
 e years\, we have discovered nearly a thousand\nexoplanets\, planets that o
 rbit stars other than the Sun. These planets\nshow a remarkable diversity\,
  from Jupiter-mass planets orbiting with\nperiods of days to "super Earths"
  with bulk densities suggestive of\nmassive water oceans. Our census of pla
 netary possibilities is nowhere\nnear complete: each new planet-finding mis
 sion yields new classes of\nexoplanets. In order to understand this diversi
 ty\, we must start at\nthe beginning: how do planets form? How does micron-
 sized interstellar\nsilicate dust coalesce into planets with radii ranging 
 from thousands\nto more than seventy thousand km? In this talk\, I will out
 line the\nresults of a number of complimentary\, interlocking studies\, all
  with\nthe goal of creating a detailed\, predictive theory for planet\nform
 ation. My focus is on the earliest stages of planet formation\nwhere dust m
 ust begin its growth in thin\, gas-rich protoplanetary\ndisks. I will discu
 ss computer simulations and theoretical\ncalculations of the rich dynamical
  interactions between dust and\npartially ionized plasma turbulence believe
 d to be found in\nprotoplanetary disks. Our results suggest that protoplane
 tary disk\nturbulence is generated and maintained by large-scale magnetic f
 ields.\n I will talk about ongoing studies of magnetic reconnection\, a key
 \ningredient in the development of those fields. Finally\, I will\nconclude
  by discussing a new\, international collaboration I am leading\nto develop
  a set of research-grade yet pedagogically useful\ncomputational tools for 
 future exoplanetary fluid dynamics research.\nThese tools are the result of
  a collaboration between astrophysicists\,\ngeophysicists\, and applied mat
 hematicians\, with the goal of allowing a\ndiverse group of users\, from un
 dergraduates to researchers\, to study a\nmultitude of problems in protopla
 netary disks\, exoplanetary\natmospheres\, and deep stellar interiors.

DESCRIPTION:"Next Generation Tests of Substellar Evolution"\n\nA broad-brus
 h view of the evolution of photometric and spectroscopic\nproperties of bro
 wn dwarfs has been in place for nearly a decade\,\nlargely thanks to modest
  initial samples of parallaxes and a few\ndynamical masses barely breaching
  the hydrogen-fusion boundary.  I\nwill present results from our high-preci
 sion infrared astrometry\nprograms at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (C
 FHT) and Spitzer and\nlaser guide star adaptive optics orbit monitoring at 
 Keck that greatly\nexpand such tests of substellar models.  With data from 
 Keck we have\nmore than tripled the numbered of dynamical masses for ultrac
 ool\ndwarfs\, pushing to much lower temperatures than before.  This has\nre
 vealed significant discrepancies between substellar models and\nobserved co
 lors\, temperatures\, and even cooling rates\, which has\nimplications for 
 cluster IMF determinations and the inferred masses\nfor directly imaged pla
 nets.  Our large sample of parallaxes from CFHT\nprovides new perspectives 
 on the cooling of brown dwarfs: we discover\na phase of rapid cloud clearin
 g (the "L/T gap") and quantify the\nseemingly paradoxical brightening in J-
 band as objects cool from L to\nT dwarfs.  Finally\, new Spitzer parallaxes
  for Y dwarfs reveal that\nthese coldest free-floating objects may not be a
 s cold as initially\nthought from comparison of their spectra to model atmo
 spheres.

DESCRIPTION:Mid-Infrared and Millimeter Spectroscopic Diagnostics of Local 
 Luminous Infrared Galaxies\n\nI will present an analysis of of 248 luminous
  infrared galaxies (LIRGs) nuclei which comprise the Great Observatories Al
 l-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS) observed with the Infrared Spectrograph on Spitze
 r in the rest-frame wavelength range between 5 and 38 microns. I will prese
 nt and compare several diagnostics effective at isolating the Active Galact
 ic Nuclei (AGN) contribution to the Mid-infrared (MIR) (fAGN) emission usin
 g [Ne V]\, [OI V]\, [Ne II]\, the 6.2 micron PAH EQW and the shape of the M
 IR continuum. These diagnostics suggest that between 10% and 13% of local L
 IRGs are AGN dominated in the MIR and that AGNs contribute 12% of the total
  bolometric luminosity of the entire sample. Warm H2 is detected in at leas
 t one transition in 40% of sources. I find that the H2 scales with aromatic
  band emission and [Si II]. The range of total H2 to IR ratios in LIRGs is 
 wider than in ULIRGs but similar to normal galaxies. We detect H2 resolved 
 emission and compare it with similar findings in radio galaxies and nearby 
 mergers.\n\nI will also present 16 CO (1-0) high resolution maps taken with
  the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-Wave Astronomy of 16 LIRGs. 
 We find a median mass of H2 of 2 x 1e10 Solar Masses\, with median molecula
 r gas surface densities of about 200 Solar Masses/pc2 as well as correlatio
 ns between the interaction stage and the average gas surface density and co
 ld gas depletion times. I will compare their morphologies to those of norma

DESCRIPTION:Replay: Echoes of Light from Eta Carinae\n\nEta Carine  is one 
 of the most massive star systems in the Milky Way. Visible in the southern 
 hemisphere\, and known for its fitful variability\, Eta Carinae underwent a
  tremendous eruptive event in the mid-nineteenth-century -the âGreat Erupti
 onâ- which brightened Eta-Carine it to became the second-brightest star in 
 the sky. This event is generally though of as the prototype supernova impos
 tor. The Great Eruption remains however unique\, lasting over ten years\, a
 nd ejecting more than ten solar masses of material in an event that release
 d ten per cent of the energy of a typical core-collapse supernova\, without
  destroying the star. \n\nWhile it is true that "You never get a second cha

 nd chance at being observed\, when light from a brightening events reflects
  off sheets of cosmic dust\, and is redirected toward earth\, allowing us t
 o re-see the eruption decades\, sometimes centuries later:  a 'light echo".
  In 2011 we discovered light echoes from EtaâCarinae's Great Eruption\, whi
 ch we can now re-observe and study with modern instrumentation.  I will sho

 s dramatic stellar eruption.

DESCRIPTION:Line-of-Sight Effects in Strong Lensing\n\nGravitational lensin
 g has been instrumental in probing the mysterious dark matter that dominate
 s the matter content of our universe. While rare\, close alignment between 
 foreground galaxies and background sources can yield multiple images of the
  background source. These strong gravitational lens systems have been used 
 to map galaxy mass distributions and constrain the Hubble Constant. As data
  and models improve\, people look to achieve percent-level precision with s
 trong lensing. To reach that goal\, we need to understand and control syste
 matic uncertainties in lens models. One key systematic arises because lens 
 models often assume the light bending is confined to a single lens plane\, 
 neglecting the perturbing effects of other galaxies along the line of sight
 . Our team has used pencil-beam redshift surveys to characterize the lines 
 of sight to strong lenses. I will introduce a new analytic framework that l
 ets us include LOS galaxies in lens models in a computationally efficient w
 ay. I will present numerical simulations to quantify LOS effects and demons
 trate that our framework handles them well. Using our framework for multi-p
 lane lensing will control an important systematic as we enter the era of pr
 ecision gravitational lensing.

 er NGC 6240 we could identify a double supermassive black hole in a single 
 galaxy\, which will merge in the future. A tight correlation between black 
 hole mass and the global properties of their host galaxies indicates a co-f
 ormation and evolution of black holes and galaxies. The X-ray sky is domina
 ted by a diffuse extragalactic background radiation\, which can almost comp
 letely be resolved into discrete sources using X-ray satellites - we observ
 e the growth phase of the population of supermassive black holes throughout
  the history of the Universe. The black holes must therefore have been form
 ed together or even before the bulk of the stars in galaxies - they are pos
 sibly the seeds of galaxy formation. What will be the fate of the black hol
 es? They can live much longer than other forms of matter and structures in 
 the Universe\, but nevertheless must evaporate after a finite time. If Dark
  Energy indeed accelerates the expansion of the Universe forever\, the most
  massive black holes can grow to hundreds of billions of solar masses\, whi
 ch can live as long as  10100 years - a truly unimaginable time span. The f
 irst compact objects\, which entered the stage of the Universe\, will then 
 also be the last ones to leave it.

DESCRIPTION:(1)\nTitle: The ESA Gaia mission\nAbstract: The ESA Gaia missio
 n will bring many outstanding contributions \nto astrophysics. Gaia\, plann
 ed to be launched in 2013\, will perform a \nmulti-epoch whole-sky survey a
 cquiring astrometric\, photometric and \nspectroscopic measurements. Compar
 ed to the successful Hipparcos \nsatellite\, Gaia will gain a factor of 50 
 to 100 in position accuracy and \na factor of 10\,000 in the number of obse
 rved stellar objects. During the \ncourse of its full 5-year mission Gaia w
 ill measure objects repeatedly\, \nwith a mean of 70 measurements. Conseque
 ntly\, Gaia will provide an \nunprecedented database to study the variabili
 ty of all types of \ncelestial objects.\n\n(2)\nTitle: Cepheids in Galactic
  Open Clusters: An all-sky membership census \nin 8-D\nAbstract: Classical 
 Cepheids in Galactic open clusters (cluster \nCepheids: CCs) have been stud
 ied extensively for multiple decades\, \nthanks to their importance as cali
 brators of the Galactic Cepheid \nperiod-luminosity relation (PLR). We here
  revisit the calibration of the \nGalactic PLR using a new sample of CCs\, 
 since even recent calibrations \nshow significant discrepancies. The CC sam
 ple employed for the \ncalibration is based on the preliminary results of a
  self-consistent \n8-dimensional all-sky census. This census is based mostl
 y on literature \ndata\, supplemented with high-precision radial velocity o
 bservations from \nboth hemispheres. New CCs are identified from our census
  and the degree \nof confidence in membership is quantified for known candi
 dates. Using \nonly bona-fide CCs\, we obtain MV = (â3.08 Â± 0.50) log P + (
 â0.94 Â± 0.42) \n[mag]\, which is in perfect agreement with the results by S
 andage\, \nTammann & Reindl (2004)\, albeit with larger error bars and an R
 MS of \n0.21mag. The key to obtaining a meaningful calibration is to employ
  \naccurate cluster distance moduli and space reddenings. A homogeneous \ns
 tudy of all bona-fide host clusters would be desirable to increase \nprecis
 ion and confidence in the calibration.

DESCRIPTION:Herschel Reveals the Cool Universe\n\nHerschel is a cornerstone
  mission of the European Space Agency (ESA)\, with major involvement from N
 ASA.  The PACS and SPIRE instruments are moderate resolution imaging spectr
 ometers and photometers that together cover the decade in wavelength from 6
 00 to 60 microns\, with spectral resolution as high as 2000.  HIFI is a sin
 gle pixel dual-polarization heterodyne spectrometer that covers frequencies
  between 470 GHz and 1950 GHz (600 microns to 150 microns wavelength) with 
 a maximum spectral resolution in excess of 1 million.  Following launch (to
 gether with the Planck cosmology mission) on May 16\, 2009\, Herschel enter
 ed its L2 halo orbit\, and once the telescope had cooled down\, commissioni
 ng observations began.  These tests were followed by a performance verifica
 tion phase\, and finally by the start of normal science observations in Fal
 l 2009.  The PACS and SPIRE instruments were brought into routine operation
  relatively smoothly\, but HIFI suffered problems with a power supply\, whi
 ch delayed the start of science observations until February 2010.  At the p
 resent time\, instrumental performance is close to or better than that expe
 cted before launch.  Science observations are expected to extend until Marc
 h 2013\, limited by the liquid helium supply. In this talk I review the cha
 racteristics of the Herschel Space Observatory and the capabilities of its 
 three science instruments.  I will also give some highlights of the very va
 ried results from Herschel.  The access with a suite of high sensitivity im
 aging and spectroscopy systems to a largely unexplored portion of the elect
 romagnetic spectrum has resulted in an exceptionally wide range of astronom
 ical discoveries\, ranging from studies of distant galaxies\, to high-resol
 ution spectroscopy of molecular clouds and star formation in the Milky Way\
 , to observations of objects within our solar system\, with surprising resu

DESCRIPTION:Title: The Ultraviolet Properties of Type Ia Supernovae\nAbstra
 ct: Studies of the ultraviolet (UV) spectra of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) 
 give us information about the objects themselves but are also motivated by 
 a need to understand and improve the methods used for cosmology standardisa
 tion.  Large supernova surveys have shown that supernova properties correla
 te with those of their hosts and it has been suggested that this is due to 
 different progenitor metallicities as the more massive galaxies/low star-fo
 rmation galaxies tend to be more metal-rich.  The UV region of the spectra 
 of SNe Ia is dominated by metal lines and so it is thought that any metalli
 city-driven effects would be strongest here.  I will discuss recent new obs
 ervational studies of SNe Ia and also how series of model spectra can help 
 to interpret the results.

 ding and Changes in the Circumgalactic Medium.\n\nAbstract: I present the f
 irst systematic survey of multiple background QSOs behind a galaxy cluster 
 with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph onboard HST to examine LyÎ± absorbing c
 louds in an active environment. In total\, 43 LyÎ± absorbers are found in an
 d around the Virgo Cluster with N_HI > 10^13 cm^-2 toward 23 QSO sightlines
 . We find LyÎ± absorbers are dominant in the outskirts and mostly coincide w
 ith the infalling substructures of the Virgo Cluster. This indicates a conn
 ection between the large-scale flow of gas around the cluster and gas in in
 dividual galaxies. The covering fraction of LyÎ± absorbing clouds is unity f
 or N_HI > 10^13 cm^-2 surrounding the cluster. These results are consistent
  with cosmological simulations. We also probe the known properties of the L
 yÎ± absorption lines and their relationship to individual galaxies. We find 
 that environment influences not only galaxies\, but also the circumgalactic
  medium significantly. These results provide important clues to how gas flo
 ws in different environments.

DESCRIPTION:Formation and evolution of our Moon: from the Giant Impact to t
 he Lunar Magma Ocean and what we really know\n\nThe composition of the luna
 r crust provides clues about the processes that formed it and hence contain
 s information on the origin and evolution of the Moon. Current understandin
 g of lunar evolution is built on the Lunar Magma Ocean hypothesis.  This hy
 pothesis is based on analyses of Apollo samples of ferroan anorthosites (>9
 0% plagioclase) and the assumption that early in its history\, the Moon was
  wholly or mostly molten due to the giant impact theory. Simulations of thi
 s theory have shown that a collision between the proto-Earth and a Mars-siz
 ed planet (Theia) can produce the Earth-Moon system with the correct masses
 \, orbits\, and angular momentum. 70-80% of the mass of the Moon originates
  from Theia\, not from Earth. However\, new results from lunar meteorites a
 nd data from new missions are currently revolutionizing our knowledge of th
 e Moon. These studies show a very high degree of similarity between the lig
 ht and heavy elemental composition (and their isotopes) of Earthâs mantle a
 nd the Moon. In light of these new data many of the âclassicâ views of the 
 surface\, interior\, and atmosphere of the Moon\, and their evolution throu
 gh time have changed\, however\, hypothesis such as the Lunar Magma Ocean a
 nd the Giant Impact Theory are still under debate. The compositions of anor
 thositic rock fragments in lunar meteorites are inconsistent with a global 
 Lunar Magma Ocean\, and more consistent with crustal anorthosites forming f
 rom serial emplacement of terrestrial like massifs. Moon formation models h
 ave to be consistent with the lunar chemistry but current versions of the g
 iant impact model are not. Debated alternative hypotheses\, that account fo
 r similarities between the Moon and the bulk silicate Earth\, include 1) fo
 rmation of the Moon from a hot\, fast-spinning Earth (fission model)\; 2) f
 ormation of the Moon from the ejection of terrestrial mantle material in a 
 heat-propelled jet\, triggered by a run-away natural geo-reactor at the Ear
 thâs core-mantle boundary. These alternative hypotheses are consistent with
  the identical isotopic composition of bulk silicate Earth and Moon for man
 y elements without relying on full post-collisional equilibration.

DESCRIPTION:How to Find the Rare Sources All New Surveys Promise: Machine-l
 earning Enabled Classification and Discovery\n\nThe falling costs of comput
 ing and CCD detectors has led to a great boom in wide-field time-domain opt
 ical surveys during the past ~decade\, with several new surveys expected pr
 ior to the arrival of LSST. This observational boon\, however\, comes with 
 a catch: the data rates from these surveys are so large that discovery tech
 niques heavily dependent on human intervention are becoming unviable. Ident
 ifying the extraordinary within large data sets requires an understanding a
 nd model of the more common sources. In this talk I will detail new methods
 \, which utilize semi-supervised machine-learning algorithms\, to automatic
 ally classify the light curves of time-variable sources. Using these method
 s\, we have produced a data-driven probabilistic catalog of variables found
  in the All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS). We identify true outliers within t
 he data via the clustering of sources which are not classified with high si
 gnificance. This has led to the discovery of several rare systems: includin
 g four new members of the R Coronae Borealis class\, which are thought to b
 e the product of low mass white dwarf mergers\, but are underrepresented in
  the Milky Way relative to the LMC.

DESCRIPTION:The Explosive Deaths of Massive Stars\n\nCore collapse supernov

 solved problem. The effects of mass\, metallicity\, binarity and rotation o
 n the evolution and subsequent explosions of massive stars are not well und
 erstood. Large samples of events\, recently collected through single untarg

 ogenitors\, including their radius and pre-explosion structure. As more dat

 omen and Minority Astronomers Strategic Engagement with Distributed\, Multi
 -Disciplinary Collaborations and Large Scale Databases\n\nIncreasingly\, re
 search in science and engineering is conducted in multidisciplinary distrib
 uted teams enabling greater access to a variety of resources. As cyberinfra
 structure becomes integrated into research\, there are accompanying changes
  in work practices\, requisite skill sets\, organizing structures and caree
 r trajectories. Research on these concomitant changes is in its earliest st
 ages so it has focused predominantly on commonalities among the majority of
  scientists. However\, previous literature has determined that there is oft
 en considerable variation in the ways that majority and minority groups wit
 hin a field experience scientific work. Very little is know about the diffe
 rent experiences of minority group members working in multi-disciplinary\, 
 distributed collaborative research teams or about their distinctive work pr
 actices within those collaborative projects. As scientific and engineering 
 research moves toward this new cyber-enabled collaborative model\, understa
 nding both majority and minority member experiences will be crucial to the 
 design\, development and deployment of appropriate cyberinfrastructure supp
 ort tools and will have important implications for increasing participation
  among members of underrepresented groups. This research is a first step in
  identifying best practices in use so that all groups can be fully supporte
 d in scientific and engineering research collaborations.\n\nThis project in
 vestigates how women scientists engaged in collaborative\, multidisciplinar
 y research build and use interpersonal relationships and the effects of the
 se relationships on their careers. Using ethnographic methods and narrative
  analysis\, the research team will conduct a pilot study of researchers usi
 ng large-scale databases in astronomy to identify everyday research practic
 es\, the organization of work\, planning\, career trajectories\, and the tr
 ansmission of knowledge to the next generation of scholars. They will focus
  on collaborative work practices\, the design\, maintenance\, revision and 
 interpretation of large-scale databases\, their career strategies\, and on 
 mentoring activities. Further\, it will shed light on whether underrepresen
 ted groups are more likely to succeed in new fields or using new methods an
 d are more likely to engage in interdisciplinary research. If so\, they may
  be a crucial asset in innovation and transformative science.\n\nThis resea
 rch has important implications for both theory and practice. It investigate
 s an area related to cyberinfrastructure use and team science and engineeri
 ng that is currently understudied: How do minority group members use cyberi
 nfrastructure and the emergent team science structure to achieve success? H
 ow can this information inform the development and refinement of the next g
 eneration of cyberinfrastructure? What steps can be taken to improve partic
 ipation by members of underrepresented groups? New cyberinfrastructure tool
 s have enabled transformative changes for some areas of science and enginee
 ring\, but little is known about which of these changes differ for various 
 groups and how each achieves success. Results of this project could enable 
 us to design collaborative science and engineering projects that increase t
 he participation of underrepresented groups and provide valuable informatio
 n for the development of appropriate cyberinfrastructure to support a varie
 ty of work practices. Identifying the experiences of minority group members
  will enable funding agencies to better understand how to support and nurtu
 re the work required to meet future scientific and engineering challenges a
 nd improve national competitiveness. \n

 as evolving super-Eddington steady states. We will begin by describing how 
 such states can existâthrough the rise of a "porous layer" which reduces th
 e effective opacity\, and then discuss various characteristics of these sta

 a modification of the classical core-mass/luminosity relation to include th

DESCRIPTION:The magnetic fields (or lack thereof) in massive stars with dis
 crete absorption components\n\nDiscrete Absorption Components (DACs) are ob
 served in saturated ultraviolet resonance lines of many\, and possibly all\
 , hot massive stars. This type of spectral variability is attributed to the
  presence of large-scale azimuthal structures present in their supersonic\,
  radiatively-driven winds. However\, the origin of these structures continu
 es to be hotly debated. One leading hypothesis proposes the presence of "ho
 t spots" on the surface of the star\, which enhance the local speed and den
 sity of the wind\, leading to fast wind streams which interact to form the 
 observed structures. Such surface features have been attributed to the pres
 ence of magnetic fields at the stellar surface. This investigation seeks to
  test this hypothesis by searching for evidence of weak\, large-scale magne
 tic fields in a small sample of bright\, well-studied DAC stars. High preci
 sion spectropolarimetic observations\, obtained at the CFHT and Pic du Midi
  observatories by the MiMeS collaboration\, were used to diagnose the prese
 nce (or place upper limits on the strength) of magnetic fields in the stell
 ar sample. This presentation reports the first results of this study. Furth
 ermore\, I will briefly discuss previous results on the mysterious WR binar
 y CV Ser.

DESCRIPTION:Experiments With IDENTIKIT\n\nTidal interactions twist galaxies
  into strange and beautiful forms.  Interactions and subsequent mergers bet
 ween galaxies may trigger starbursts\, fuel AGNs\, and transform disk galax
 ies into ellipticals.  IDENTIKIT was originally developed as a fast approxi
 mate scheme for modeling the tidal morphology and  kinematics of interactin
 g disk galaxies.  In this form\, it was first used to implement an interact
 ive modeling tool for galaxy collisions\; tests with  artificial data showe
 d that the morphology and kinematics of merging galaxies strongly constrain
  their initial conditions.  This tool is now being applied to real galaxies
 .  More recently\, IDENTIKIT has been used to develop a mapping from the pr
 esent state of a tidal encounter back to the initial conditions\; this offe
 rs a way to partly automate the search for dynamical models of galaxy encou
 nters.  Finally\, IDENTIKIT's theoretical applications include a comprehens
 ive way to evaluate the mass and extent of tidal features as functions of h
 alo structure.

DESCRIPTION:The Increasingly Diverse Family of Star Clusters\n\nThe Advance
 d Camera for Surveys on board the Hubble Space Telescope has allowed us to 
 determine the structural parameters of extragalactic globular clusters to g
 reat accuracy. Most extragalactic star clusters have a scale size narrowly 
 centered around three parsecs\, similar to their Galactic counterparts. In 
 the last decade\, however\, a rush of discovery of new stellar systems\, br
 ighter\, larger\, and more massive than "standard" globular clusters has ta
 ken place. The scale sizes of globular clusters\, extended star clusters an
 d ultra-compact dwarfs in Virgo (M87)\, the Coma cluster\, and the fossil g
 roup NGC 1132 will be presented. The results of N-Body simulations helps us
  to understand the physical mechanisms that determine the scale-sizes of st

DESCRIPTION:Title: The debris disk - terrestrial planet connection\n\nAbstr
 act: \nThere exists strong circumstantial evidence from their eccentric orb
 its that most of the known extra-solar planetary systems are the survivors 
 of violent dynamical instabilities. Here we explore the effect of giant pla
 net instabilities on the formation and survival of terrestrial planets. We 
 numerically simulate the evolution of planetary systems around Sun-like sta
 rs that include three components: (i) an inner disk of planetesimals and pl
 anetary embryos\; (ii) three giant planets at Jupiter-Saturn distances\; an
 d (iii) an outer disk of planetesimals comparable to estimates of the primi
 tive Kuiper belt.  Our main result is a strong correlation between the evol
 ution of the inner and outer parts of planetary systems\, i.e. between the 
 presence of terrestrial planets and debris disks. Strong giant planet insta
 bilities - that produce very eccentric surviving planets - destroy all rock
 y material in the system\, including fully-formed terrestrial planets if th
 e instabilities occur late\, and also destroy the icy planetesimal populati
 on. Stable or weakly unstable systems allow terrestrial planets to accrete 
 in their inner regions and significant dust to be produced in their outer r
 egions\, detectable at mid-infrared wavelengths as debris disks. Stars olde
 r than ~100 Myr with bright cold dust emission (in particular at Î» ~ 70 Î¼m)
  signpost dynamically calm environments that were conducive to efficient te
 rrestrial accretion. Such emission is present around ~16% of billion-year o
 ld Solar-type stars.\n

DESCRIPTION:Project Minerva: Big Exoplanet Science from Small Telescopes\n\
 nThe Kepler mission has identified over 2300 candidate planets in the past 
 two years\, adding to the over 500 confirmed planets from radial velocity (
 RV) surveys. One of the most striking results of these surveys is that the 
 number of planets increases rapidly with decreasing size. There may in fact
  be more Earth-like planets in the Galaxy than stars. There must be terrest
 rial-sized planets around nearby stars\, though few have yet been discovere
 d. Finding these planets requires high precision RV observations and high c
 adence transit observing to densely sample the orbital phase. Project Miner
 va will surmount these obstacles with a dedicated observatory for detection
  of super-Earths and close-in Earth-like planets. Our array of four 0.7-m t
 elescopes will operate in two modes: jointly with a high precision fiber-fe
 d spectrometer capable of detecting the RV signal of an Earth orbiting a lo
 w mass star\, and independently for photometric transit detection surveys. 
 Minerva is a multi-institution collaboration among Caltech\, the University
  of Montana and Penn State University.

DESCRIPTION:Overview of the James Webb Space Telescope Observatory and its 
 Capabilities for Exoplanet Observations\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope (
 JWST) is a cryogenic\, 6.5 meter diameter space telescope. JWST has a uniqu
 e architecture\, compared to previous space telescopes\, that is driven by 
 its science requirements\, a passively cooled cryogenic design\, and the ne
 ed to stow the observatory for launch. JWST's large\, segmented mirror meet
 s the requirement for high angular resolution in the infrared\, coupled wit
 h a significant increase in collecting area compared to the Spitzer and Hub
 ble Space telescopes in order to detect the first galaxies. JWST's unique f
 ive-layer sunshield allows the telescope and instrument module to passively
  cool to cryogenic temperatures. JWST will be launched on an Ariane 5\, and
  so both its telescope optics\, and the sunshield have to be stowed in orde
 r to fit the Ariane 5 fairing. Following launch the sunshield and telescope
  optics must be deployed\, and the primary mirror phased for science operat
 ions. In this presentation we will review the design of the observatory and
  highlight recent progress in the construction of the JWST observatory. In 
 particular\, we address recent progress with the telescope optics\, sunshie
 ld and spacecraft. We also review the expected scientific performance of th
 e  observatory for observations of exosolar planets by means of transit  ph
 otometry and spectroscopy\, and direct coronagraphic imaging.

DESCRIPTION: Accretion of Warm Ionized Gas in Milky Way-Sized Galaxies at L
 ow z\n\nThe Milky Way has been forming stars at a nearly constant rate of 1
 -3 Msun/yr over the past several billion years.  It would have exhausted it
 s gas reservoir in the disk on a significantly shorter timescale\, unless t
 he gas supply was replenished continuously.  The source of this fuel for st
 ar formation is unclear.  Based on high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations
  of a Milky Way-mass galaxy in a fully cosmological setting\, we argue that
  (1) the gas inflow occurs mostly along filamentary structures in the halo\
 ; and (2) the warm-hot (T = 10^5--10^6 K) and hot (T > 10^6 K) ionized gase
 s dominate the overall mass accretion in the system over a large range of d
 istances\, extending from the virial radius to the vicinity of the disk.  M
 ost of the inflowing gas (by mass) does not cool\, and the small fraction t
 hat manages to cool does so primarily close to the galaxy (R <~ 20 kpc)\, p
 erhaps comprising the neutral gas that may be detectable as\, e.g.\, high-v
 elocity clouds.  The neutral clouds are embedded within larger\, accreting 
 filamentary flows\, and represent only a small fraction of the total mass i
 nflow rate.  The inflowing gas has relatively low metallicity (Z/Z_solar < 
 0.2).  The outer layers of the filamentary inflows are heated due to compre
 ssion as they approach the disk.  In addition to the inflow\, we find high-
 velocity\, metal-enriched outflows of hot gas driven by supernova feedback.
   Our results are consistent with observations of halo gas at low z.\n\n\nB

DESCRIPTION:Title:  Negative Effective Magnetic Pressure Instability: A pos
 sible\nmechanism for formation of active regions in the Sun.\n\nAbstract: W
 e present the first demonstration of the negative effective\nmagnetic press
 ure instability in direct numerical simulations of\nstably stratified\, ext
 ernally forced\, isothermal hydromagnetic\nturbulence in the regime of larg
 e plasma beta. By the action of this\ninstability\, an initially uniform ho
 rizontal magnetic field forms flux\nconcentrations whose scale is large com
 pared to the turbulent scale.\nWe further show that the magnetic energy of 
 these large-scale\nstructures is only weakly dependent on the magnetic Reyn
 olds number\,\nprovided its value is large enough for the instability to be
  excited.\nOur results support earlier mean-field calculations and analytic
  work\nwhich identified this instability. Applications to the formation of\
 nactive regions in the Sun are discussed.

DESCRIPTION:Electromagnetic Emission from Supermassive Black Hole Mergers\n
 \nI will review ideas that may be useful in identifying electromagnetic\n(E
 M) emission from supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. In\nparticular\, 
 any detectable EM emission is likely to be time-variable\,\nwhich should ai
 d in this identification. I will discuss four\npossibilities for such varia
 ble emission: (i) a roughly periodic\nsignal due to the orbital motion prio
 r to coalescence\, (ii) a\ntransient pre-cursor caused by the gas trapped i
 nside the binary's\norbit\, and transients "after-glows" produced by (iii) 
 post-merger gas\naccretion and (iv) by merger-induced shocks in the circumb
 inary\ndisk. I will argue that these time-variable EM signatures may be use
 d\nto identify unique counterparts of gravitational wave sources expected\n
 to be detected by LISA and by Pulsar Timing Arrays.  I will also\nhighlight
  the extra science that will be enabled if an EM counterpart\nis found\, su

DESCRIPTION:Two short talks:\n\nTitle: 1D microphysical cloud model for Ear
 th and Earth-like exoplanets\, water clouds in the convective troposphere\n
 A. Zsom\, L. Kaltenegger\, C. Goldblatt\n\n1D codes that are used to model 
 exoplanet atmospheres often treat clouds in an approximate way: the surface
  albedo is increased to mimic the effects of clouds (Kasting et al.\, 1993\
 , Pavlov et al.\, 2000)\, or the measured cloud properties of Earth are ado
 pted as standard (Kitzmann et al.\, 2010\, Goldblatt et al.\, 2011). The fo
 rmer method introduces errors to the modeled spectra of the exoplanet\, as 
 clouds shield the lower atmosphere and thus modify the spectral features. T
 he latter method works only for an exact Earth-analog\, but it is challengi
 ng to extend to other planets.\nTo address this issue\, we developed a micr
 ophysical cloud model\, which calculates the cloud properties self-consiste
 ntly. As a test\, the cloud model can reproduce the observed properties of 
 Earth\, such as the average albedo\, surface temperature\, and the global e
 nergy budget. In this talk\, I will describe the cloud model\, its assumpti
 ons and free parameters\, and show how the free parameters (such as cloud f
 raction\, aerosol number density\, etc.) influence the climate of Earth.\n\
 n\nTitle: A 1D cloud model for brown dwarfs\nA. Zsom\, C. Helling\n\nThe st
 ate of the art cloud models for hot-Jupiters (Helling et al. 2006) simulate
  nucleation and mixing of vapors\, as well as the condensation\, vertical s
 edimentation\, and mixing of particles\, but do not include particle coagul
 ation. Using time-scale arguments\, I show that coagulation can significant
 ly alter the particle size distribution and should not be neglected. I star
 ted develop a new Monte Carlo-based cloud model that includes all of the ab
 ove-described physical processes. During the last 15 minutes of my talk\, I
  will shortly introduce the model of Helling et al. 2006\, describe how thi
 s new cloud model will improve on it\, and show preliminary results on the 
 code development. \n

DESCRIPTION:The Hunt for Exomoons with Kepler\n\nExtrasolar moon may be fre

 strobiological significance but would also greatly further our understandin
 g of planet/moon formation theories. For the first time\, the detection of 
 a transiting planet-moon system is moving from the realms of theory to obse
 rvation due to the unprecedented photometric precision being achieved by Ke
 pler. In this talk\, I will discuss how we might find a transiting exomoon\
 , exploring both the dynamical effects (such as transit timing variations) 
 and the eclipse effects (such as mutual eclipses) which may be observable. 
 It is shown that Kepler is capable of finding Earth-sized and -mass moons. 
 I will then introduce a new systematic program to search these elusive obje
 cts\, "The Hunt for Exomoons with Kepler" (HEK). I will discuss the objecti
 ves\, target selection methods\, fitting techniques and vetting strategies 
 for HEK along with the present status of the project.\n

DESCRIPTION:Vertical structure of a supernova-driven\, tubulent\, magnetise
 d ISM\n\nSupernovae drive the circulation of interstellar material both wit
 hin galaxies and into galactic haloes. I will present 3D MHD simulations of
  a modelled ISM with parameterized heating and cooling in which supernovae 
 drive turbulence and establish a vertically-stratified\, multi-phase medium
 . The resulting turbulent and thermal pressures support the disk of each co
 mponent\, producing relative scale heights in line with observations. The m
 agnetic field has relatively little impact on the scale heights of differen
 t phases of the ISM in our models. This feedback naturally allows ionizing 
 radiation from O stars in the disk to photoionize the warm ionized medium\,
  and some fraction of the ionizing photons escape from the disk into the Ga
 lactic halo. Cold and warm ($T \\lesssim 10^4$~K) gas in high velocity clou
 ds can thus be photoionized by Lyman continuum radiation emitted in the dis
 k\, consistent with observations that the H-alpha-emitting mass in the Smit
 h Cloud is comparable to the H I-emitting mass.\n

 pecial Relativity has been tested with ever-increasing precision since its 
 publication in 1905. One of its key predictions is that only light itself c
 an travel at the speed of light. Any particles moving faster must be travel
 ing backward in time. Einstein's Theory of General Relativity makes even mo
 re audacious predictions about curved space and time.\n\nTwo recent papers 
 by a large consortium of physicists using the worldâs most powerful acceler
 ator are claiming the discovery of neutrinos moving at speeds slightly in e
 xcess of the speed of light. Sensitive tests of spacetime curvature and dra
 gging are made possible by state-ofâthe art telescopes and satellites. Eins
 tein might be wrong. Our understanding of space\, time\, mass\, and energy 
 all hang in the balance until we know if\, or how relativity theory fails.\

 itics\, as well as other teams who are racing to test relativity with unpre

DESCRIPTION:Contrary to their dimness\, M-dwarf stars hold significant prom
 ise for illuminating the processes that govern the formation and evolution 
 of stars\, planets\, and the Milky Way. Calibrating the fundamental paramet
 ers of M-dwarfs\, however\, is a difficult challenge from both an observati
 onal and theoretical perspective. In particular\, the determination of thei
 r metallicities has proved to be extremely problematic. To address this pro
 blem\, we obtained K-band spectra for 133 nearby (d<33 parsecs) M-dwarfs\, 
 including 18 M-dwarfs with FGK companions\, 11 M-dwarf planet hosts\, more 
 than 2/3 of the M-dwarfs in the Northern 8pc sample\, and several M-dwarfs 
 from the LSPM catalog. From these spectra\, we measured equivalent widths o
 f the Ca and Na lines\, and a spectral index quantifying the absorption due
  to H2O opacity. We used the strength of the Na\, Ca and H2O features of 18
  M-dwarfs with reliable metallicity estimates from FGK companions to constr
 uct an empirical [Fe/H] indicator applicable for M dwarfs with near-solar m
 etallicities (-0.69<[Fe/H]<+0.31\,sigma=0.141 dex). For the first time\, we
  derive an expression for an M-dwarf's overall metallicity [M/H]\; quantita
 tive comparisons to model atmospheres\, which are benchmarked according to 
 overall metallicity\, provide a qualitative validation of our approach\, bu
 t also demonstrate an overall offset between the atomic line strengths pred
 icted by models as compared to actual observations. Our metallicity estimat
 es reproduce expected correlations between metallicity and Galactic space m
 otions and HÎ± emission line strengths\, as well as returning statistically 
 identical metallicities for M-dwarf companions within a shorted multiple sy
 stem. Finally\, we provide a list with promising M-dwarfs targets for plane
 t searches in the Solar Neighborhood based on their metallicity\, HÎ± emissi
 on\, and rotation.

 s)\, X-ray binaries\, and active galactic nuclei.  Since\njets from WDs sha
 re many of the physical characteristics of\nnon-relativistic YSO jets\, whi
 le displaying phenomena typically\nassociated with relativistic XRB jets\, 
 they provide a bridge between\nnon-relativistic and relativistic collimated
  outflows.  Accreting WDs\nhave arguably the best understood accretion disk

 with jets from\nWDs are observationally accessible. Jets from WDs may thus

 ivistic jets that power synchrotron lobes\, and jets that are\ntriggered by
  nova explosions. I will briefly touch on how these\nobservations can const

DESCRIPTION:Hear the dramatic account of the most tumultuous year in modern
  astronomy by the astronomer who inadvertently caused it. In 2005\, astrono
 mer Mike Brown made the discovery of a lifetime: the tenth planet\, Eris\, 
 which was 27 percent more massive than Pluto. But instead of simply adding 
 one more planet to our solar system\, his discovery ignited controversy tha
 t launched Brown into the public eye and culminated with the demotion of Pl
 uto. Brown will discuss his memoir from that year\, How I Killed Pluto and 
 Why It Had It Coming. A book signing will follow.

DESCRIPTION:PySALT:  The SALT Science Pipeline\n\nThe Southern African Larg
 e Telescope (SALT) is a modern 10m class\ntelescope with a large user commu
 nity consisting of 13 partner\ninstitutions.  The two primary instruments o
 n SALT are SALTICAM and\nthe Robbie Stobbie Spectrograph (RSS) and by far\,
  the majority of the\nearly science produced by SALT will be from these two
  instruments.\nThese instruments provide a range of observing modes\, inclu
 ding\nFabry-Perot imaging\, polarimetry\, and high speed photometry.  Due t
 o\nthe large user community\, resources available\, and unique observations
 \nmodes of SALT\, the development of reduction and analysis software is\nke
 y to maximizing the scientific return of the telescope.  We describe\nthe c
 urrent efforts at SAAO to develop PySALT\, a set of tools for the\nreductio
 ns and analysis of SALT data.  PySALT is developed in the\nPython/PyRAF env
 ironment and takes advantage of the large library of\nopen-source astronomi
 cal software.  The goals in the development of\nPySALT are: (1) Provide sci
 ence quality reductions for the major\noperational modes of SALT\, (2) Crea
 te analysis tools for the unique\nmodes of SALT\, and (3) Create a framewor
 k for the archiving and\ndistribution of SALT data. The benefits in develop
 ing PySALT are\nhighlighted through early results from high-speed photometr
 y from\nSALT.  Finally\, we discuss the planned development for PySALT alon
 g\nwith how the SALT community can participate.

DESCRIPTION:Data Stream Integration for Modeling Exosystems\n\nThe pace of 
 exoplanet discovery has been steadily accelerating.  New detection methods 
 are progressively mapping out more and more of the parameter space of plane
 tary and orbital characteristics.  Early results from Kepler and plans for 
 future ground-based surveys indicate that future exoplanet databases will p
 rovide us with detailed statistics on many different planet types.  Given t
 he expectation that future databases will include many different observatio
 ns of the same targets\, it is useful to consider how these varying data st
 reams may interact.  If we assume that any data gathered about an extra-sol
 ar planetary system (exosystem) is a partial observation of a single underl
 ying system\, then all observations can be used to construct a unified exos
 ystem model.  To do so\, we must treat data streams as partial observations
  of a Markov process\, governed by the known laws of gravity and optics\, a
 nd relate them to a common parameter set.  We also need to accurately quant
 ify the error of the measurement.  I present a candidate parameter set suit
 able for multiple observing techniques used today and a method for incorpor
 ating observations into a common exosystem model.  Priors for the exosystem
  state are calculated from known exoplanet statistics\, and multiple method
 s are considered for calculating posterior parameter distributions given ne
 w observations.

DESCRIPTION:Data Stream Integration for Modeling Exosystems\n\nThe pace of 
 exoplanet discovery has been steadily accelerating.  New detection methods 
 are progressively mapping out more and more of the parameter space of plane
 tary and orbital characteristics.  Early results from Kepler and plans for 
 future ground-based surveys indicate that future exoplanet databases will p
 rovide us with detailed statistics on many different planet types.  Given t
 he expectation that future databases will include many different observatio
 ns of the same targets\, it is useful to consider how these varying data st
 reams may interact.  If we assume that any data gathered about an extra-sol
 ar planetary system (exosystem) is a partial observation of a single underl
 ying system\, then all observations can be used to construct a unified exos
 ystem model.  To do so\, we must treat data streams as partial observations
  of a Markov process\, governed by the known laws of gravity and optics\, a
 nd relate them to a common parameter set.  We also need to accurately quant
 ify the error of the measurement.  I present a candidate parameter set suit
 able for multiple observing techniques used today and a method for incorpor
 ating observations into a common exosystem model.  Priors for the exosystem
  state are calculated from known exoplanet statistics\, and multiple method
 s are considered for calculating posterior parameter distributions given ne
 w observations.

DESCRIPTION:PySALT:  The SALT Science Pipeline\n\nThe Southern African Larg
 e Telescope (SALT) is a modern 10m class\ntelescope with a large user commu
 nity consisting of 13 partner\ninstitutions.  The two primary instruments o
 n SALT are SALTICAM and\nthe Robbie Stobbie Spectrograph (RSS) and by far\,
  the majority of the\nearly science produced by SALT will be from these two
  instruments.\nThese instruments provide a range of observing modes\, inclu
 ding\nFabry-Perot imaging\, polarimetry\, and high speed photometry.  Due t
 o\nthe large user community\, resources available\, and unique observations
 \nmodes of SALT\, the development of reduction and analysis software is\nke
 y to maximizing the scientific return of the telescope.  We describe\nthe c
 urrent efforts at SAAO to develop PySALT\, a set of tools for the\nreductio
 ns and analysis of SALT data.  PySALT is developed in the\nPython/PyRAF env
 ironment and takes advantage of the large library of\nopen-source astronomi
 cal software.  The goals in the development of\nPySALT are: (1) Provide sci
 ence quality reductions for the major\noperational modes of SALT\, (2) Crea
 te analysis tools for the unique\nmodes of SALT\, and (3) Create a framewor
 k for the archiving and\ndistribution of SALT data. The benefits in develop
 ing PySALT are\nhighlighted through early results from high-speed photometr
 y from\nSALT.  Finally\, we discuss the planned development for PySALT alon
 g\nwith how the SALT community can participate.

DESCRIPTION:Neptune's Atmospheric Dynamics from Millimeter and Near-Infrare
 d Observations\n\nStatia Luszcz-Cook / Berkeley\n\nSolar System science has
  the unique advantage that objects are close enough to explore directly. Ho
 wever\, while recent and ongoing space programs exist for the terrestrial p
 lanets\, and for the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn\, the ice giants have be
 en visited only once\, by Voyager 2 in the 1980's. Further spacecraft explo
 ration of Uranus or Neptune is unlikely for at least two more decades. Ther
 efore\, Earth-based observational techniques are instrumental to our contin
 ued progress towards understanding the ice giant planets.\n\nI will discuss
  recent work that aims to better understand Neptune's global atmospheric dy
 namics through the analysis of state-of-the art ground-based near-infrared 
 and millimeter observations. Using OSIRIS\, the near-infrared AO-assisted f
 ield-integral spectrometer on Keck II\, we unambiguously measure spectra fo
 r individual clouds on Neptune's disk. These data\, analyzed with our radia
 tive transfer models\, enable us to assess latitudinal and vertical variati
 ons in cloud properties\, which constrain other atmospheric properties such
  as vertical wind shear\, velocity dispersion\, and meridional circulation.
  Using the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA)
 \, we observe disequilibrium species in Neptune's atmosphere\, allowing us 
 to probe Neptune's global composition\, circulation\, and external environm
 ent. This research educates extrasolar planet atmospheric models\, and prov
 ides important clues for understanding the formation and evolution of our o
 wn Solar System.\n\n\nBackground material:\nhttp://www.geochemsoc.org/publi

DESCRIPTION:``Retired'' Planet Hosts: Not So Massive\, Maybe Just Portly Af
 ter Lunch\n\nJames P. Lloyd\nDepartment of Astronomy\, Cornell University\,
  Ithaca NY\n\nStudies of the planet abundance as a function of stellar mass
  have shown a strong increase in the frequency of planet occurrence around 
 stars more massive than 1.5 Msun\, and that such stars are deficit in short
  period planets.  These planet searches have relied on giant stars for a sa
 mple of high mass stars\, which are hostile to precision Doppler measuremen
 ts while on the main sequence due to rotation and activity.  However\, the 
 observationally inferred mass for exoplanet hosting giants is inconsistent 
 with the expected masses of a sample of field giants.  These stars are more
  likely to have originated from a main sequence population of late F/early 
 G dwarfs with mass 1.0-1.2 Msun\, only slightly more more massive than the 
 typical FGK dwarfs with Doppler detected planets.  The erroneous mass deter
 minations most likely arise from the extrapolation of solar-calibrated mixi
 ng length theory to the red giant branch\, and suggests that the isochrones
  need revision with a slightly larger mixing length on the red giant branch
 .  The deficit of short period planets is most likely explained by tidal ca
 pture.  The planet abundance increase requires either a high rate of false 
 positives in giant stars due to signals of stellar origin or a new mechanis
 m to migrate planets inwards during the post main sequence evolution of the
  host star.

  a small group of experts to review the entire Kepler \ndata set\, but with
  over 170\,000 volunteers examining the light curves on \nthe Planet Hunter
 s interface\, we have the ability to visually inspect \nthe entire public d

DESCRIPTION:Data Stream Integration for Modeling Exosystems\n\nThe pace of 
 exoplanet discovery has been steadily accelerating.  New detection methods 
 are progressively mapping out more and more of the parameter space of plane
 tary and orbital characteristics.  Early results from Kepler and plans for 
 future ground-based surveys indicate that future exoplanet databases will p
 rovide us with detailed statistics on many different planet types.  Given t
 he expectation that future databases will include many different observatio
 ns of the same targets\, it is useful to consider how these varying data st
 reams may interact.  If we assume that any data gathered about an extra-sol
 ar planetary system (exosystem) is a partial observation of a single underl
 ying system\, then all observations can be used to construct a unified exos
 ystem model.  To do so\, we must treat data streams as partial observations
  of a Markov process\, governed by the known laws of gravity and optics\, a
 nd relate them to a common parameter set.  We also need to accurately quant
 ify the error of the measurement.  I present a candidate parameter set suit
 able for multiple observing techniques used today and a method for incorpor
 ating observations into a common exosystem model.  Priors for the exosystem
  state are calculated from known exoplanet statistics\, and multiple method
 s are considered for calculating posterior parameter distributions given ne
 w observations.

DESCRIPTION:PySALT:  The SALT Science Pipeline\n\nThe Southern African Larg
 e Telescope (SALT) is a modern 10m class\ntelescope with a large user commu
 nity consisting of 13 partner\ninstitutions.  The two primary instruments o
 n SALT are SALTICAM and\nthe Robbie Stobbie Spectrograph (RSS) and by far\,
  the majority of the\nearly science produced by SALT will be from these two
  instruments.\nThese instruments provide a range of observing modes\, inclu
 ding\nFabry-Perot imaging\, polarimetry\, and high speed photometry.  Due t
 o\nthe large user community\, resources available\, and unique observations
 \nmodes of SALT\, the development of reduction and analysis software is\nke
 y to maximizing the scientific return of the telescope.  We describe\nthe c
 urrent efforts at SAAO to develop PySALT\, a set of tools for the\nreductio
 ns and analysis of SALT data.  PySALT is developed in the\nPython/PyRAF env
 ironment and takes advantage of the large library of\nopen-source astronomi
 cal software.  The goals in the development of\nPySALT are: (1) Provide sci
 ence quality reductions for the major\noperational modes of SALT\, (2) Crea
 te analysis tools for the unique\nmodes of SALT\, and (3) Create a framewor
 k for the archiving and\ndistribution of SALT data. The benefits in develop
 ing PySALT are\nhighlighted through early results from high-speed photometr
 y from\nSALT.  Finally\, we discuss the planned development for PySALT alon
 g\nwith how the SALT community can participate.

DESCRIPTION:Near-Infrared Observations Toward Protostars as Proxies for Sol
 ar System Chemical Evolution\n\nComparing isotopic ratios toward young stel
 lar objects and molecular clouds to meteoritic data is a powerful tool for 
 informing our understanding of early Solar System chemistry. High-resolutio
 n near-infrared CO spectra were obtained with the CRIRES spectrograph (R = 
 95\,000) on the Very Large Telescope for several low- to intermediate- mass
  young stellar objects and foreground clouds in the local Solar neighborhoo
 d. Precise column densities and oxygen and carbon isotope ratios were deriv
 ed from the line profiles of 12C16O\, 13C16O\, 12C18O and 12C17O isotopolog
 ues. Signatures of CO self-shielding were found in the oxygen isotope ratio
 s toward several targets. The derived [12C]/[13C] ratios range from approxi
 mately 84 â 158\, values that are significantly higher than those of the am
 bient parent clouds (65 â 68). There is a general positive trend between th
 e solid [12C16O] and gas-phase [12C16O] /[13C16O]\, suggesting that partiti
 oning of the 12C16O and 13C16O isotopologues between ice and gas may partia
 lly explain the spread in [12CO]/[13CO] observed in the gas. These results 
 indicate that CO isotopologue fractionation between ice and gas may play a 
 significant role in protostellar chemistry\, and should be considered in mo
 dels including early Solar System chemistry. I will discuss these results a
 nd  my plans for new protostellar observations and theoretical models in th
 e context of the new astronomy laboratory at the North Carolina Museum of N
 atural Sciences. \n\nReview:\nhttp://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011LPI....42.1

DESCRIPTION:The Role of Dwarf Galaxy Interactions in Shaping the Magellanic
  System and Implications for Magellanic Irregulars and Dwarf Spheroidals \n
 \nAbstract: \n\nI will present a new numerical model of the evolution of th
 e Milky Way's largest satellite galaxies\, the Large and Small Magellanic C
 louds (LMC/SMC)\, in which their current internal structure and kinematics 
 and large-scale gas morphology are dictated by their mutual tidal interacti
 ons\, rather than interactions with the Milky Way. This picture is consiste
 nt with the recent HST proper motions of the LMC (Kallivayalil et al. 2006)
  - using cosmologically motivated models for the Milky Way\, these new prop
 er motions imply that the Clouds have not made multiple passages about the 
 Milky Way. \n\nIn particular\, the LMC's peculiar off-center bar and one-ar
 med spiral morphology is a natural by-product of a recent direct collision 
 with the SMC.  This scenario may shed light on the dynamical state of a cla
 ss of dwarf galaxies known as Magellanic Irregulars (de Vaucouleurs & Freem
 an 1972)\, which\, like the LMC\, are asymmetric spirals with off-center ba
 rs\, but are rarely associated with massive spirals. \n\nAs a result of its
  collision with the LMC\, the simulated SMC is left in a highly disturbed s
 tate where its older stellar population does not display a pronounced rotat
 ion curve\, as observed. The SMC may thus represent an object in transition
  from a dwarf Irregular galaxy to a dwarf Spheroidal.  This process is expe
 cted to occur ubiquitously in small groups of low mass galaxies and may rep
 resent a generic mode of dwarf galaxy evolution that is independent of prox
 imity to a massive host.\n\nGraduate students\, please see Gurtina's recent
  paper: \nhttp://lanl.arxiv.org/abs/1201.1299

DESCRIPTION:Titel: VLT imaging of the $\\beta$ Pictoris gas disk\n\nAbstrac
 t: $\\beta$ Pictoris is the only debris disk star in which\ncircumstellar a
 tomic gas has been detected and resolved\, however\, the\ninformation about
  its spatial distribution is limited. Previous\nobservations using slit spe
 ctroscopy has indicated that the\ndistribution of gas emission follows that
  of the dust\, revealing\nintriguing tilts and asymmetries that could sugge
 st dynamical\ninteractions between the disk and planetary bodies. Consideri
 ng\nphotoevaporation time-scales\, the observed gas is probably not\nprimor
 dial\, and a continuous production of atomic gas in the disk\nseems likely.
  In order to better understand the origin of atomic gas\nin the disk of $\\
 beta$ Pic\, we have imaged the gas disk by mapping\nemission lines from Fe 
 I (at 3860 Ã) and Ca II (at 3934 and 3968 Ã)\nusing the fiber facility FLAM
 ES/GIRAFFE at the Very Large Telescope\n(VLT) with the large integral-field
 -unit ARGUS\, producing the first\ncomplete image of Fe I emission\, probin
 g the neutral gas in the disk\nplane\, and Ca II\, probing vertically more 
 extended gas. In this talk I\nwill present the outcome of our observations 
 and also present results\nfrom subsequent abundance modeling using a gas io
 nization code for\ngas-poor debris disks.

DESCRIPTION:Constraints on planet formation from direct imaging\n\nTraditio
 nally\, there have been two main competing theories of planet formation: Co
 re accretion\, in which planets form sequentially through accumulation of a
  solid core followed by accretion of gas onto the core\, and disk instabili
 ty\, in which planets form directly through gravitational collapse in a gas
 eous disk. In this talk\, I will show that by combining direct imaging data
  with the body of observations from radial velocity and transits that have 
 been taken over the past decade\, the issue of which mechanism is the main 
 mode of planet formation can be quantitatively addressed for the first time
 \; and that most likely\, the vast majority of exoplanets form by core accr
 etion. While these arguments can now be made on a population basis\, the fo
 rmation history of individual planetary systems remains a challenging issue
 . I will discuss some such individual systems based on the (often conflicti
 ng) indications of how they might have formed\, and point out ways of resol
 ving these uncertainties in the future.\n\nPaper presented in the talk:\nht

DESCRIPTION:Title:\nInsight into Star Formation at the Galactic Center from
  Kinematics of the Young Stellar Disk\n\nAbstract:\nThe Galactic center (GC
 ) contains both a supermassive black hole (SMBH) and a collection of young\
 , massive stars\, a seemingly paradoxical combination given our current kno
 wledge of star formation.  Approximately half of these young stars orbit th
 e black hole in a coherent\, clockwise stellar disk.  The dynamics of this 
 young population can be used to constrain theories of star formation in the
  hostile environment of a SMBH. I will present high-precision astrometry (~
 0.1 mas) of ~120 young stars obtained with the Keck telescopes over 16 year
 s\, including seven years of Laser Guide Star Adaptive Optics imaging and s
 pectroscopy. Accelerations in the plane of the sky are detected as far out 
 as 1.5" (~0.06 pc)\, the furthest from the SMBH to date for these young sta
 rs. Such measurements allow us to study the structure of the stellar disk a
 nd directly estimate stellar orbital parameters\, including eccentricities\
 , without making a priori assumptions about disk membership\, as has been d
 one in the past.  I find that several disk stars have eccentricities > 0.2\
 , while many others have eccentricity lower limits of 0.2. This finding ren
 ders in situ star formation in a circular disk with a normal IMF around the
  SMBH unlikely.\n\nReview Papers:\nhttp://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...

DESCRIPTION:Detection of Molecular Oxygen in Interstellar Clouds - An Astro
 chemical Dilemma\n\nPaul Goldsmith\nJPL\, California Institute of Technolog
 y\n\nOxygen is the third most abundant element in the cosmos. In the gas ph
 ase\, oxygen can be ionized\, atomic\, or in molecular\, and it is also inc
 orporated into interstellar grains. Models of the gas-phase chemistry in de
 nse clouds predict molecular oxygen (O2) to be almost as abundant as carbon
  monoxide (CO). Searches for Galactic O2 carried out with the SWAS and Odin
  spacecraft have yielded upper limits on the abundance of molecular oxygen 
 typically 2 orders of magnitude below those predicted. The most plausible e
 xplanation is based on depletion of atomic oxygen onto dust grains\, result
 ing in incorporation of this species into water that remains on the grain s
 urface.  Remaining gas-phase oxygen is largely incorporated into CO\, leavi
 ng little for gas-phase O2.  The Herschel Open Time Key Project ``HOPââ (He
 rschel Oxygen Project) addresses this important problem in astrochemistry\,
  exploiting the high angular resolution and sensitivity of the Herschel HIF
 I instrument to observe 3 rotational transitions of O2. We focus on the det
 ection of O2 towards the H2 Peak 1 position near KL in Orion.  This region 
 has several compact molecular sources that have emission at the same veloci
 ty as found for the observed O2 lines and we explore a model based on warmi
 ng grains and restoration of gas phase chemistry that can explain our obser
 vations.  We also discuss low-velocity C-shock models that can produce the 
 observed column density of O2 and conclude with a discussion of some of the
  implications for oxygen chemistry in dense interstellar clouds and the pec
 uliarities of the star forming condensations in Orion.

DESCRIPTION:Empirical Constraints on the Formation and Evolution of Low-Mas
 s Stars and Brown Dwarfs: A Data-Intensive Approach\n\nKeivan Guadalupe Sta
 ssun\, Vanderbilt University \n\nRecent and ongoing large surveys\, both fr
 om the ground and from space\, are enabling new data-intensive approaches t
 o a variety of problems in stellar astrophysics. This talk describes three 
 such projects\, each serving as a vignette of a different but complementary
  mode of data-intensive research into low-mass star formation and evolution
 . The X10000 Project takes a panchromatic\, time-domain approach to study t
 he structures of young stellar coronae in order to understand the role of e
 xtreme coronal mass ejections in the angular momentum evolution of young st
 ars. As a by-product of this work\, we have determined the first robust emp
 irical relationship between X-ray flare energy and coronal mass loss for th
 e Sun. The SLoWPoKES project takes an ensemble\, data-mining approach to ex
 tract from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey the largest sample of wide low-mass
  binaries ever assembled\, which can be used to constrain binary formation 
 theory and for refining the fundamental mass-age-activity-rotation-metallic
 ity relations for low-mass stars. The EB Factory project takes a time-domai
 n\, data-mining approach to identify rare\, but astrophysically very intere
 sting\, case studies from among the large numbers of eclipsing binaries bei
 ng harvested by surveys for transiting exoplanets. We will highlight recent
  discoveries from this work\, and will draw these results together to eluci
 date the physical interrelationships between stellar rotation\, magnetic fi
 eld generation\, and stellar structure during the star-formation process.

DESCRIPTION:FU Orionis outbursts and Transitional disks: What do they tell 
 us about protoplanetary disk accretion and planet formation\n\n  The mechan
 isms and efficiencies of mass transport in accretion disks can be best cons
 trained by studying their time-dependent behavior. By studying FU Orionis o
 bjects\, which are outbursting young protostellar disks\, we constrained th
 e outbursting accretion disk extends to AU scale with the inferred limits o
 n the viscosity parameter alpha~0.02-0.2. By carrying out both analytic stu
 dies and 2-Dimensional radiation hydrodyanmic simulations\, we proposed the
  outburst is due to the thermal activation of the magnetorotational instabi
 lity (MRI) at ~AU scales by the gravitational instability (GI). Extending t
 his work to study protostellar disk long-term evolution\, we found that the
  outbursting behavior of the protostellar disks during the infall phase all
 eviates the so called âluminosity problemâ\, and the layered accretion at t
 he later phase leads to a massive âdead zoneâ where planet formation is fav
 ored.\n   In the second part of my talk\, I will describe â transitional di
 sksâ- protoplanetary disks with gaps and holes and how do they imply young 
 planets in disks. I have studied gap opening by dynamically-interacting mul
 tiple giant planets with 2-Dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. I found th
 at even with as many as four giant planets\, additional substantial dust de
 pletion (e.g. growth) is required to explain these gaps and holes\, which s
 heds light on the early planet formation environment.
